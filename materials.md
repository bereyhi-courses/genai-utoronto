## Book

There is indeed no single textbook for this course, and we use various resources in the course. The following recent textbooks are however good resources for __practicing hands-on skills.__ Note that we are __not__ simply learn to implement only! We study the fundamentals that led to development of this framework, nowadays known as __generative AI.__ Of course, we try to get our hands dirty as well and learn how to do implementation.

With respect to the first part of the course, the following book provides some good read:

## Course Materials: Reading List

This section will be completed gradually through the semseter. I will try to break down the essence of each item, so that you could go over them easily. 

### Language Models
You may review the idea of Seq2Seq learning and transformers in the following references:
