  <h2><strong>Code of Honor</strong></h2>
  Assignments are designed to enhance your understanding and skills, constituting a significant portion of your final assessment. They must be completed <strong>individually,</strong> as engaging in any form of academic dishonesty violates the principles of the Code of Honor. If you encounter any challenges while solving the assignments, please contact the instructional team for guidance.

As mentioned in the main page, the course will consists of 3 assignment sets. Each assignment includes Written Questions that are to be solved (or briefly answered), and Programming Tasks which are to be implemented in Python.

## How to Submit
We use [Crowdmark](https://crowdmark.com/), which has an easier interface and makes the chance of formatting mistakes less. When submitting, please make sure to follow the instructions below. Note that these instructions are __very important__ for correction and investigation of your submissions. Deviation from these instructions could lead to up to __10% deduction (per item).__

On Crowdmark, please submit the answer of each question separately, following the steps below. Please note that failure to meet the formatting can lead to mark deduction.

- For Written Questions, you can submit handwritten or typed answers as a .pdf , .jpg or .png file.

- For Programming Questions, please print __your code and the requested outputs__ as a .pdf file and upload it in the answer field of the corresponding question on Crowdmark. Your uploaded .pdf should contain __all figures, diagrams and codes that are requested in the question.__ 

- The source codes should also be submitted as a __single .zip file__ attached to the last item on Crowdmark.
    - Please set the file name  __Lastname_Firstname_Assgn#.ipynb__

The deadlines are very strict and cannot be extended for the sake of fairness
