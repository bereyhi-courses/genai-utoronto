  <h2><strong>Code of Honor</strong></h2>
  This project is intended to deepen your understanding and develop your skills, and it forms a substantial part of your final evaluation. It must be completed collaboratively as a group. Any form of academic dishonesty is a violation of the Code of Honor. You are encouraged to use publicly available resources, provided that all <em>sources are clearly cited</em> and your individual <em>contributions are clearly explained.</em> Failure to properly acknowledge your contribution may be considered a <strong>lack of participation</strong>, and projects without meaningful individual contributions will be deemed <strong>incomplete.</strong>

The course project will be seriously started in the secound half of the course. In these project, you choose a topic from the list of available topics and work through semester to deliver the requested outcomes of the project. Regardless of topic of the project, you will need to follow the following steps:

1. Make a group (the group size will be discussed later) and choose your topic by the end of __Week 6.__ It is strongly suggested to choose as soon as possible to get into the problem and start preliminaries.
2. You will be allocated to a TA, who could help you throughout the project.
3. Deliver initial milestones of the project in a progress briefing. The progress briefing will serve as the base for your final report.
4. Deliver your final results by the end of semester. This includes the final report, the source codes, and a final presentation in our internal seminar.
